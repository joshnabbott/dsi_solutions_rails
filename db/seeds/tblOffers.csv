	<p align=""justify""><strong>Program Details <br />
	</strong>Trex is the leading manufacturer of composite decking and railing, using recycled polyethylene ""PE"" (i.e., stretch film). Because of the huge demand for their products, Trex is the leading consumer of recycled and reclaimed PE in the nation. </p>
	<p align=""justify"">Trex offers MillerCoors Distributors a program to recycle your stretch film and will pay top market price for your used plastic (currently $0.18 per pound). Trex will pick up and haul away your baled plastic. </p>
	<p align=""justify"">To participate in the program, each MillerCoors Distributor must consider the following: </p>
	<p align=""justify"">1. Each MillerCoors Distributor will need one baler to consolidate the recycled plastic.<br />
<ul>
<li>Purchase directly from Trex for $0.10 per pound for your first 100,000 recycled pounds <br />
	  <strong>    </strong> (amount will be deducted from your $0.18 per pound profits) <br />
<li>Purchase a used or new baler <br />
<li>Use the baler you currently own </p></li></ul>
	<p align=""justify"">2. MillerCoors Distributors purchasing a baler directly from Trex must produce at least one truckload (i.e., 37,000 pounds) of PE annually. </p>
	<p align=""justify"">3. MillerCoors Distributors who already own a baler or who obtain a baler from another means (i.e., new or used baler suppliers), Trex will pick up 10-15 bales at a time (minimum of 10,000 pounds per pick up). </p>
	<p align=""justify"">If you are unsure about meeting these criteria or have questions, Ali (Magel) Comeaux (<a href=""mailto:amagel@dsi-mail.com"">amagel@dsi-mail.com</a>) can help answer them and coordinate discussions with Trex.<br />
	  <br />
	  <span style=""font-weight: bold"">Benefits </span><br /><ul>
<li>Receive $0.18 per pound for your recycled stretch film <br />
<li>Reduce your landfill and hauling fees - Trex will pick up and haul away the recycled plastic <br />
<li>Eliminate the environmental impact of sending used stretch film to landfills </li></ul><br />

</strong>The Association of Independent Beverage Distributors (""AIBD""), a subsidiary of the Coca-Cola Bottlers' Association (""CCBA""), is focused on extending benefit programs designed for the Coca-Cola bottlers to the MillerCoors Distributors. </p>
<p>Benefits now available to the MillerCoors Distributors include Medical, Dental, Vision, Life and Disability programs. Medical, Dental and Vision benefits are self-funded programs offered through CIGNA's innovative structure, which allows distributors to establish fixed costs with varying levels of risk sharing. Cost reduction is achieved through conversion to a self-funded program, where premium taxes and state mandated benefit requirements for those currently insured are eliminated. Further savings will be gained as more members, both MillerCoors Distributors and Coke bottlers, join the program thus increasing the group's buying power and reducing administrative costs. </p>
<p>Life and Disability programs are fully insured programs offered at group buying rates through Hartford and/or Mutual of Omaha and are available to all MillerCoors Distributors whether or not you participate in the Medical program. </p>
<p><a href=""dl/MC Health Benefits Presentation_WEB_031711.pps"">Click here</a> to view the AIBD health benefits program presentation. </p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Currently, ~60 Coke bottlers and 10 MillerCoors Distributors are enrolled in the health benefits program and almost 8,500 employees have joined the new program </li>
  <li> Savings for participating employers have averaged 13%; accounting for over $3,000,000 in savings </li>
  <li> Provide access to quality, comprehensive coverage at reduced costs </li>
  <li> Reduced administrative costs below current programs available to small/medium size employers reflecting economies of scale and large group pricing</li>
  <li>Superior wellness and care management, focused on decreasing the trend line in subsequent years </li>
  <li> Low stop loss rates provided by the AIBD Captive </li>
  <li> Program is open to MillerCoors Distributors of all sizes </li>

Protect yourself from spikes in fuel costs by utilizing the fuel hedging program offered to Network Services Distributors by the Coca-Cola Bottler's Association (???CCBA???). This program allows Network Services Distributors, through DSI, to participate in the existing fuel hedging program for Coca-Cola bottlers. </p>

Any fuel user can participate in the futures market and lock in and protect their fuel cost subject to trading minimums of 42,000 gallons a month per call option.

In these instances, you will retain your lower pricing but still benefit from pricing #9075 in that it will provide a ceiling price on all other qualified purchases. Ask your Wholesale Manager to review your account and determine if pricing #9075 should apply to all qualified purchases or if there are certain items that may be further reduced. </p> </a>

<p>*DSI has negotiated pricing profile #9075 for all Johns Manville's Pinnacle and Summit contractors; this is NAPA's most aggressive national account pricing available to the public. However, as pricing #9075 applies to thousands of parts, there may be some parts for which you have already negotiated, or have access to, lower pricing. In these instances, you will retain your lower pricing but still benefit from pricing #9075 in that it will provide a ceiling price on all other qualified purchases. Ask your Wholesale Manager to review your account and determine if pricing #9075 should apply to all qualified purchases or if there are certain items that may be further reduced. </p> </a>

</strong>Distributor Innovations & Benefit Savings Solutions (""DIBSS""), a subsidiary of the Coca-Cola Bottlers' Association (""CCBA""), is focused on extending benefit programs designed for the Coca-Cola bottlers to the Network Services and MillerCoors distributors. </p>

<p>Life and Disability programs are fully insured programs offered at group buying rates through Hartford and/or Mutual of Omaha and are available to all Network Services Distributors whether or not you participate in the Medical program. </p>

Any fuel user can participate in the futures market and lock in and protect their fuel cost subject to trading minimums of 42,000 gallons a month per call option. However, CCBA has designed this program to accommodate smaller call option contracts ??? allowing you to purchase contracts directly from CCBA in 1,000 gallon increments. Please note you do not take possession of fuel through this program ??? this works like insurance. You have a contract that if fuel goes above a certain level, you will receive a monetary settlement. </p>

	<p align=""justify""><strong>Program Details: <br>
</strong>The Association of Independent Beverage Distributors (""AIBD""), a subsidiary of the Coca-Cola Bottlers' Association (""CCBA""), is focused on extending benefit programs designed for the Coca-Cola bottlers to other beverage businesses - namely the MillerCoors Distributors and WSWA Wholesalers within DSI's purchasing program. </p>
<p>Benefits now available to the WSWA Wholesalers include Medical, Dental, Vision, Life and Disability programs. Medical, Dental and Vision benefits are self-funded programs offered through CIGNA's innovative structure, which allows wholesalers and distributors to establish fixed costs with varying levels of risk sharing. Cost reduction is achieved through conversion to a self-funded program, where premium taxes and state mandated benefit requirements for those currently insured are eliminated. Further savings will be gained as more members (MillerCoors Distributors, WSWA Wholesalers, and Coke bottlers) join the program thus increasing the group's buying power and reducing administrative costs. </p>
<p>Life and Disability programs are fully insured programs offered at group buying rates through Hartford and are available to all WSWA Wholesalers whether or not you participate in the Medical program. </p>
<p><a href=""dl/WSWA Health Benefits Presentation_032910.pps"">Click here</a> to view the AIBD health benefits program presentation. </p>
<p><strong>Benefits: </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>32 Coke bottlers and 3 MillerCoors distributors are enrolled in the health benefits program and over 3,000 employees have joined the new program </li>
  <li> Savings for those participating employers have averaged 13%; accounting for over $3,000,000 in savings </li>
  <li> Provide access to quality, comprehensive coverage at reduced costs </li>
  <li> Reduced administrative costs below current programs available to small/medium size employers reflecting economies of scale and large group pricing</li>
  <li>Superior wellness and care management, focused on decreasing the trend line in subsequent years </li>
  <li> Low stop loss rates provided by the AIBD Captive </li>
  <li> Program is open to WSWA Wholesalers of all sizes </li>

<li>Use the baler you currently own </p></li></ul>
	<p align=""justify"">2. WSWA Wholesalers purchasing a baler directly from Trex must produce at least one truckload (i.e., 37,000 pounds) of PE annually. </p>
	<p align=""justify"">3. WSWA Wholesalers who already own a baler or who obtain a baler from another means (i.e., new or used baler suppliers), Trex will pick up 10-15 bales at a time (minimum of 10,000 pounds per pick up). </p>
	<p align=""justify"">If you are unsure about meeting these criteria or have questions, Jon Wormsley (<a href=""mailto:jwormsley@dsi-mail.com"">jwormsley@dsi-mail.com</a>) can help answer them and coordinate discussions with Trex.<br />

</strong>The Association of Independent Beverage Distributors (""AIBD""), a subsidiary of the Coca-Cola Bottlers' Association (""CCBA""), is focused on extending benefit programs designed for the Coca-Cola bottlers to the WSWA Wholesalers. </p>
<p>Benefits now available to the WSWA Wholesalers include Medical, Dental, Vision, Life and Disability programs. Medical, Dental and Vision benefits are self-funded programs offered through CIGNA's innovative structure, which allows distributors to establish fixed costs with varying levels of risk sharing. Cost reduction is achieved through conversion to a self-funded program, where premium taxes and state mandated benefit requirements for those currently insured are eliminated. Further savings will be gained as more members, both WSWA Wholesalers and Coke bottlers, join the program thus increasing the group's buying power and reducing administrative costs. </p>
<p>Life and Disability programs are fully insured programs offered at group buying rates through Hartford and/or Mutual of Omaha and are available to all WSWA Wholesalers whether or not you participate in the Medical program. </p>
<p><a href=""dl/WSWA Health Benefits Presentation_WEB_031711.pps"">Click here</a> to view the AIBD health benefits program presentation. </p>
<p><strong>Benefits </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Currently, 60 Coke bottlers and 10 MillerCoors Distributors are enrolled in the health benefits program and almost 8,500 employees have joined the new program </li>
  <li> Savings for participating employers have averaged 13%; accounting for over $3,000,000 in savings </li>
  <li> Provide access to quality, comprehensive coverage at reduced costs </li>
  <li> Reduced administrative costs below current programs available to small/medium size employers reflecting economies of scale and large group pricing</li>
  <li>Superior wellness and care management, focused on decreasing the trend line in subsequent years </li>
  <li> Low stop loss rates provided by the AIBD Captive </li>
  <li> Program is open to WSWA Wholesalers of all sizes </li>

</strong>Distributor Innovations & Benefit Savings Solutions (""DIBSS""), a subsidiary of the Coca-Cola Bottlers' Association (""CCBA""), is focused on extending benefit programs designed for the Coca-Cola bottlers to DSI's members, including the Johns Manville Pinnacle and Summit Contractors, MillerCoors distributors, and Wine and Spirits Wholesalers. </p>
<p>Benefits now available to the Johns Manville Pinnacle and Summit Contractors include Medical, Dental, Vision, Life and Disability programs. Medical, Dental and Vision benefits are self-funded programs offered through CIGNA's innovative structure, which allows contractors to establish fixed costs with varying levels of risk sharing. Cost reduction is achieved through conversion to a self-funded program, where premium taxes and state mandated benefit requirements for those currently insured are eliminated. Further savings will be gained as more members, Johns Manville Pinnacle and Summit Contractors, MillerCoors distributors, Wine and Spirits Wholesalers and Coke bottlers, join the program thus increasing the group's buying power and reducing administrative costs. </p>
<p>Life and Disability programs are fully insured programs offered at group buying rates through Hartford and/or Mutual of Omaha and are available to all Johns Manville Pinnacle and Summit Contractors whether or not you participate in the Medical program. </p>

<ul>

  <li> Savings for participating employers have averaged 13%; accounting for over $3,000,000 in savings </li>
  <li> Provide access to quality, comprehensive coverage at reduced costs </li>
  <li> Reduced administrative costs below current programs available to small/medium size employers reflecting economies of scale and large group pricing</li>
  <li>Superior wellness and care management, focused on decreasing the trend line in subsequent years </li>
  <li> Low stop loss rates provided by the DIBSS Captive </li>

<p>*DSI has negotiated pricing profile #9075 for all WSWA Wholesalers; this is NAPA's most aggressive national account pricing available to the public. However, as pricing #9075 applies to thousands of parts, there may be some parts for which you have already negotiated, or have access to, lower pricing. In these instances, you will retain your lower pricing but still benefit from pricing #9075 in that it will provide a ceiling price on all other qualified purchases. Ask your Wholesale Manager to review your account and determine if pricing #9075 should apply to all qualified purchases or if there are certain items that may be further reduced. </p></a>
