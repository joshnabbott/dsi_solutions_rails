1,"DSI Home Page","ALL","<p align=""justify"">Distributors Solutions LLC (???DSI???) was formed in June 2007 to act as a purchasing consortium to support the independent distributors of Coors Brewing Company products in North America. We are based in Golden, Colorado. </p>
<p>On July 1, 2008, we expanded our scope to include all MillerCoors distributors per the JV between Coors Brewing Company and SAB Miller. </p>
<p>In 2009, we further expanded to include two additional groups of distributors and contractors. On January 6, 2009 our partnership with Network Services, a group of more than 75 paper and sanitary supply distributors, was launched. On February 23, 2009 we launched our partnership with Johns Manville; bringing the DSI purchasing program to JM's Pinnacle and Summit level contractors. </p>
<p>On March 31, 2010 our portfolio of purchasing programs was extended to all Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America member distributors, bringing the total number of businesses under the DSI group purchasing umbrella to roughly 1,200.</p>   
<p>Although DSI is an independent company from MillerCoors, Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, Network Services, and Johns Manville, we work closely with the management within each entity to add value to distributors and contractors in purchasing services. </p>
<p>Our goals are to reduce costs to the distributors and contractors on the one hand and to provide efficiencies and increased volume opportunities for selected suppliers on the other hand. </p>

	<p><strong>Program Details <br>
</strong>General Motors Fleet and Commercial Operations offers MillerCoors Distributors the Competitive Assistance Program (""CAP"") for the 2011 model year. The CAP program offers distributors incentives, payable as an invoice credit, off their GM vehicle purchases. </p>
<p>The 2011 Silverado and Sierra HD (3/4 and 1 ton pick ups) have been significantly improved by GM with upgrades on towing, GVW and payload. <a href=""dl/GM 2011 HDCS &  Emissions_060310 WEB.pps"">Click here</a> for more information on the updated pick ups, as well as information on the new diesel emissions. </p>
<p><strong>Benefits </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> Incentives range between $250 and $5,300 off invoice for the 2011 model year.</li>
  <li>Only one incentive can be applied, i.e. a retail incentive can not be combined with the CAP fleet incentive. However, if the retail incentive is greater than the CAP fleet incentive, you can take the retail incentive and should continue to have your dealer record this transaction under FAN 883262 and Processing Code TC6. </li>

<p>*DSI has negotiated pricing profile #9075 for all MillerCoors Distributors; this is NAPA's most aggressive national account pricing available to the public. However, as pricing #9075 applies to thousands of parts, there may be some parts for which you have already negotiated, or have access to, lower pricing. In these instances, you will retain your lower pricing but still benefit from pricing #9075 in that it will provide a ceiling price on all other qualified purchases. Ask your Wholesale Manager to review your account and determine if pricing #9075 should apply to all qualified purchases or if there are certain items that may be further reduced. </p>  </a>
